# NEON_tutorial


ESA Webinar Recording: Access NEON. On March 27th, we gave a 1 hr ESA webinar on Accessing NEON Data & Infrastructure. The recording will be posted once available: https://www.neonscience.org/opportunities/events/access-neon-data-portal-tools-accessing-understanding-neon-data-%E2%80%93-esa-webinar
Access NEON Data on the Data Portal walk through slide deck: (direct download: https://www.neonscience.org/sites/default/files/Access_NEON_Data_Using_the_Data_Portal.pptx; webpage: https://www.neonscience.org/data/getting-started-neon-data
Over 100 data tutorials, particularly the Use the neonUtilities package to access NEON data tutorial, are available to help people learn to access & work with NEON data : https://www.neonscience.org/resources/data-tutorials
 
On particular alternative, that may work well for the REU students (and anyone else who’d like to join) would be doing a 1-2 hr “Access NEON” workshop webinar with them. That is analogous to the ESA webinar above but can be tailored to fit the skills and research interest of the REU students. And of course, would allow the students to ask their own questions.  If setting up something like this is of interest to a group you work with, please let me know.
